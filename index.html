                <br>
                <p> completed my secondary education at Dorkhany High School in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2016, where I developed a strong foundation in subjects such as biology, chemistry, and mathematics. My academic journey continued at this school, where I further honed my skills in the sciences, which paved the way for my pursuit of a medical degree. <br> <br>  From 2017 to 2024, I have been pursuing a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) at Charagh Medical University  in Afghanistan. Throughout my university studies, I have gained comprehensive knowledge in fields such as anatomy, physiology, and clinical medicine. My education has been enriched by hands-on clinical experience, where I worked closely with medical professionals, learning to diagnose and treat patients under supervision.
                    <br> <br>Additionally, in 2024, I completed a Graphic Design certification in Islamabad, Pakistan. This course allowed me to develop creative skills in digital design using tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. My training in graphic design has given me an eye for detail and visual communication, which complements my medical studies, especially in creating clear and informative presentations and materials.</p>
